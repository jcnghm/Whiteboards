# Fizz Buzz #2
# Write a function to print all numbers 1 to n, but there are some constraints
# If the number is divisible by 3, print ‘Fizz’ instead of the number
# If the number is divisible 5, print ‘Buzz’ instead of the number
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print ‘FizzBuzz’ instead of the number
# Otherwise, simply print the number

# SOLUTION:

def fizzBuzz(x):
   for i in range(1,x+1):
       if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
           print("FizzBuzz")
       elif i % 3 == 0:
           print("Fizz")
       elif i % 5 == 0:
           print("Buzz")
       else:
           print(i)
