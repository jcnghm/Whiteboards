# Fizz Buzz
# Write a function to print all numbers 1 to n, but there are some constraints
# If the number is divisible by 3, print ‘Fizz’ instead of the number
# If the number is divisible 5, print ‘Buzz’ instead of the number
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print ‘FizzBuzz’ instead of the number
# Otherwise, simply print the number


# SOLUTION:

def fizzBuzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

fizzBuzz(30)
