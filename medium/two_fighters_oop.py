# Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

# Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

# Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

# Both health and damage_per_attack will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.
